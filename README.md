Raspberry Pi Pico W Projects

## Overview
All of these projects are personal projects which I have completed and implemented. Justifications and media can be found on my github.io page. I have found the Pico W to be an extremely versatile platform for the development of all kinds of embedded systems projects. All of these projects use the on-board WiFi chip on the board.
